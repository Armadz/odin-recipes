        <p>Turon (banana lumpia) are sweet and crunchy fried snacks filled with jackfruit and saba bananas and popular in the Philippines.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>24 8-by-8 inch square lumpia wrappers</li>
            <li>4 very ripe plantains</li>
            <li>1 12-ounce jar jackfruit</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Deforst spring rolls</li>
            <li>Trim both ends of each plantain and do not remove the skin. Cut each plantain in half across and then cut lengthwise into 3 planks. Peel the plantain pieces. </li>
            <li>Drain the jackfruit and reserve the syrup in a small bowl. Cut each piece of jackfruit into 1/2-inch wide strips.</li>
            <li>To assemble the turon, lay the wrapper on a clean surface with a corner pointing towards you (it should resemble a diamond). Place one slice of plantain horizontally about 2 inches from the lower corner and top with 2 strips of jackfruit. Fold the nearest corner of the wrapper over the plantain and jackfruit tautly and roll twice over. Fold in the left and right corners and continue to roll upwards until about 1 inch of wrapper remains. Dip your finger into the reserved jackfruit syrup to moisten the top corner and seal. Repeat with the remaining fruit and wrappers. Reserve the syrup.</li>
            <li>Fill a medium saucepan with 2 inches of oil. Heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Dip each turon into the jackfruit syrup, allowing any excess to drip off and carefully place into the oil. Fry, turning occasionally, in batches of 6 at a time until deep golden brown and crisp all over, about 3 minutes per side. Place the turon on the wire rack and let cool. Repeat with remaining turon and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
